# ðŸ”¹ Software Pack Built for Timex Sinclair 2068 Cartridges.

I have made several sets of programs for these cartridges. All files have the .Dck extension. That is means you can run this files on some Emulator like FUSE or others. Remember to skip or delete the first nine bytes when you want to write the binary file to some EPROM.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode LROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS With Menu from EPROM 27C512.

## ðŸ”¹ Built to lung and using too much the wrist.
This is the hardest way to build cartridges that boot the programs from any Dock Bank memory address.
