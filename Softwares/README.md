# ðŸ”¹ Software Pack Built for Timex Sinclair 2068 Cartridges.

I have made severals sets of programas for theses cartridges.

## ðŸ”¹ START IN MODE LROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ START IN MODE AROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ START IN MODE AROS EPROM 27C612.

## ðŸ”¹ Built to lungs and using too much the wrist.
This is the hardest way to build cartridges that boot the programs from any Dock Bank memory address.
