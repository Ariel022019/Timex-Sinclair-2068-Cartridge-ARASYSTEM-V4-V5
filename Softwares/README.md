# ðŸ”¹ Software Pack Built for Timex Sinclair 2068 Cartridges.

I have made several sets of programs for these cartridges. All files have the .Dck extension. That is means you can run this files on some Emulator like FUSE or others. Remember to skip or delete the first nine bytes when you want to write the binary file to some EPROM.
In this section I'll focus on the others games (most of the Spectrum games) and skip the seven classic games made for cartridges on the TS2068.

You will see that in all projects, I am using the emulator FUSE for get Snap Shot files, and then I am using the "SnapToTap R2.3 (PC/Windows), by Arda Erdikmen" for to convert from Snap Shot files to TAP format  from

The binary file can be created to start or boot in LORS mode [Cartridge Loader Maker:](https://www.retrocomputacion.com/forum/hardware_s/108010/eproms-para-las-plaquetas-timex-sinclair-2068-command-cartridge-v2/&p=7), or in AROS mode  [Cartridge Maker AROS V2:](https://www.retrocomputacion.com/forum/hardware_s/108010/eproms-para-las-plaquetas-timex-sinclair-2068-command-cartridge-v2/&p=8)
Both web pages (they are in Spanish) explain how to do it.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode LROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS With Menu from EPROM 27C512.

## ðŸ”¹ Built to lung and using too much the wrist.
This is the hardest way to build cartridges that boot the programs from any Dock Bank memory address.
The 7Games9K.DCK (7 Games 9K bytes) and 8Games8K.DCK (8 Games 8K bytes) files are more complicated to build. It is necessary to make an installer for each of the games and place them in the best place in the eprom (27C512). And play with the eight 8Kbyte chunks, the Stack Point and other environments.
