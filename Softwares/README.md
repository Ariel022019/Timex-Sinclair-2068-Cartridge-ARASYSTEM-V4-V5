# ðŸ”¹ Software Pack Built for Timex Sinclair 2068 Cartridges.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode LROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS EEPROM 28C256 or EPROM 27C256.

## ðŸ”¹ Start in Mode AROS With Menu from EPROM 27C512.

This is the hardest way to build cartridges that boot the programs from any Dock Bank memory address.
